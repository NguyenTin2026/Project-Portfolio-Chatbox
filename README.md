# NguyenTin2026 — My Portfolio Website (with Chatbox)

This repo contains my personal portfolio website. I built it with plain **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and I added a **chatbox** so visitors can interact with the site instead of only reading static pages. The goal is simple: make it easy for someone to understand who I am, what I’ve built, and how to contact me.

## What’s inside this project

### Portfolio pages
The website is split into multiple pages so everything stays clean and easy to navigate:

- `index.html` — landing/home page
- `about.html` — background + quick intro
- `education.html` — education history
- `work.html` — work/experience section
- `projects.html` — projects page
- `contact.html` — contact page

### Styling + behavior
- `style.css` controls the look and layout of the whole site
- `script.js` handles the interactive parts (UI behavior and the chatbox)

### Projects data (easy to update)
Instead of hard-coding all project info directly in HTML, I keep project data in:
- `projects.json`

That way, I can add/edit projects in one place and keep the UI consistent.

### Chatbox content
- `questions.txt` is where I keep common questions/answers (or notes) that the chatbox can use.

### Contact form (server-side)
- `contact.php` handles contact form logic
- `test.php` is used for testing/debugging the PHP side

> Note: PHP files won’t run on GitHub Pages. If you want the contact form to work, you need a PHP-capable host.

How to run it locally
1) Quick way (static preview)

If you only need to preview the website:

Open index.html directly in a browser, or run a simple local server:
python -m http.server 8000

Then visit:

http://localhost:8000

2) If you need PHP working (contact form)

Run a local PHP server from the project folder:
php -S localhost:8080

3) Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/NguyenTin2026.git
cd NguyenTin2026
